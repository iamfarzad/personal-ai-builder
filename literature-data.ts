Participants were divided into groups that solved typical tasks (market research, requirements specification, backlog prioritization, etc.) either with specialized AI tools, with general AI (ChatGPT), or without AI. Preliminary findings show that the groups with AI support completed the tasks significantly faster – AI could cut down the execution time for certain phases considerably, without the quality of deliverables deteriorating. Product managers also reported that the AI aids improved the work experience on repetitive tasks. The McKinsey team further found that the most experienced PMs derived the greatest benefit from AI, probably because they were better able to integrate AI output with their own domain expertise.

(2) Engineering design: Although generative AI can help with prototype ideas, trust in the tools is crucial – in the Loft example, they chose to pause AI use during the actual construction to ensure reliability. (3) User testing and analysis: After prototyping, the team used AI to transcribe and analyze feedback from video tests with customers, where ChatGPT summarized input and identified areas for improvement. The article illustrates that generative AI can increase the pace and scope of idea exploration, make iterations faster and more data-driven, but that humans still need to assess the realism of the ideas (e.g., filter out 'hallucinations' that are not practically feasible).",

      "This article discusses how classical change management principles must be adapted when organizations adopt AI technologies. Based on experiences from large IT implementations, Martins emphasizes that clear top-down communication and stakeholder involvement are at least as important in AI introductions as in previous IT projects. At the same time, AI requires an even more nuanced change management approach: The technology evolves rapidly and can profoundly affect work processes, so leaders must address cultural shifts, ethical considerations, and the need for continuous learning among employees. The article suggests drawing lessons from successes and failures in large IT integrations – e.g., the importance of training and pilot testing – and illustrates this with a hypothetical case where a bank introduces AI. The conclusion is a 'best practice' checklist for change management in the AI age, which emphasizes that change management is a critical driver for innovation and growth when new technology is to be adopted.",

    summary:
      "This qualitative study (with case and literature review) finds that AI and big data initiatives can improve efficiency, decision precision, and innovation in businesses, but that success depends strongly on the organization's change readiness. The authors observe that technological implementation often faces challenges such as employee resistance to change, inadequate IT infrastructure, and concerns around data security. Effective change management – with visionary leadership, good communication, and training measures – is identified as a key factor in overcoming these obstacles. Organizations that succeeded with AI rollout often had top executives who actively supported the initiative and invested in competence building among employees. The study concludes that AI and digital transformation can provide great benefits, but only if people and culture develop in step with the technology – a clear call to integrate change management strategies in all digital transformation projects.",

    summary:
      "McKinsey presents research findings showing an increasing performance gap between companies that are digital/AI leaders and those lagging behind. In the period 2020-22, the total shareholder return (TSR) for digital/AI leaders was 2-6 times higher than for laggards across sectors. The report explains that these leaders have developed strong digital capabilities and change practices that create 'compounding' competitive advantages over time. In contrast, previous surveys show that the average company only extracts less than a third of expected value from its digital transformations. McKinsey points out that the leading companies are characterized by holistic integration of technology in core processes, as well as good change management and competence development. The message is that organizations must 'rewire' to avoid being left behind – which involves investing in people, processes, and culture in addition to technology.",

    summary:
      "This HBR award-winning article examines how leading businesses globally are conducting large-scale reskilling of employees in the face of AI-driven change. Based on interviews with leaders in around 40 organizations, the authors identify five paradigm shifts in the approach to training and competence: Among other things, that reskilling is now considered a continuous responsibility at all leadership levels, that it is increasingly integrated as a strategic part of business management (not just HR measures), and that many companies create internal 'academies' or partnerships to offer relevant training in new skills. The article provides practical examples – for instance, how one company let employees 'shadow' AI systems and learn from them, while another used internal apprenticeship programs – and highlights that the most successful reskilling initiatives also focus on culture: promoting a learning culture where employees don't fear AI, but see opportunities. The main message is that reskilling is a critical part of change management in the AI age, and that those who succeed think differently about who, what, and how to learn in step with technological development.",

    summary:
      "McKinsey's latest annual AI survey shows a dramatic increase in the prevalence of AI across businesses. 65% of respondents say that the organization now uses generative AI regularly – almost doubling from the previous year. Total AI adoption level (including all types of AI) has jumped to 72% in 2024, after hovering around 50% for several years. The survey also indicates that AI is now being used in more parts of the business: Half of companies use AI in at least two business functions, up from a third the year before. This is largely due to the genAI boom. Furthermore, the majority of companies report material benefits: those that have implemented genAI see both cost reductions and increased revenue in the departments where the technology has been adopted. At the same time, awareness of risk has increased – more businesses have begun to mitigate e.g., inaccuracy and bias – but McKinsey points out that there is still a way to go: less than half have measures for even the most relevant risks. All in all, the report signals that 2024 marks the transition from experimentation to value extraction for AI, with a small core of 'high-performing' companies leading the way.",

    summary:
      "This global survey focuses on the use of generative AI in larger companies. A key finding is that almost all organizations with advanced genAI initiatives experience positive returns: 74% say that their most advanced genAI measures meet or exceed ROI expectations. About 20% report an ROI over 30%. The report also shows that the most tested genAI solutions so far are in IT (e.g., code help, IT support), but that many industries are now pushing AI into core areas for competitive advantage – e.g., marketing in the consumer sector, operations in the industrial sector, R&D in pharmaceuticals, etc., instead of just general functions. Deloitte notes that leaders are realistic: over half expect it will take more than a year to solve challenges around benefit realization, adoption, governance, training, and trust for genAI projects. Nevertheless, the will is strong – 76% say they are willing to give the initiative at least 12 months more investment even if value targets are not immediately met. The message is that while 'everyone' is now trying genAI and seeing promising results, one must be patient and systematic to scale successfully.",

      "This op-ed argues that responsible AI should be integrated into all digital transformation initiatives. Gulley points out that AI potentially can increase global GDP by $15.7 trillion by 2030, but warns that 'with great power comes great responsibility' – algorithms can introduce biases, errors, and injustices if used uncritically. The article mentions that organizations worldwide, from technology companies to the OECD, have already formulated principles for responsible AI. At the same time, regulatory requirements are tightening: The EU is close to adopting its AI regulation (AI Act), which will affect businesses globally by requiring risk assessments and transparency. For businesses, this means that proactive investment in responsible AI – which encompasses ethics, morality, and legislation – is not only social responsibility, but also necessary to remain competitive and avoid liability in the future. This article thus puts the 'soft side' of digital transformation in focus, by reminding that technological progress must be accompanied by governance and values.",

    category: "data-ethics",
    summary:
      "This case article describes how Unilever translates AI ethics principles into practical processes. Unilever established early a set of ethical AI guidelines – for example, a policy that 'no decision with major impact on individuals should be fully automated'. To operationalize this, they have introduced an AI Assurance process: Each new AI application is risk-assessed for ethical and efficiency hazards before rollout. The company's cross-disciplinary committee (including legal, HR, data/technology) evaluates the use case, and external experts are brought in for complex cases. Typical assessment criteria include explainability, robustness, bias, and privacy. When needed, 'human in the loop' is set – e.g., they decided that CV selection should not be left 100% to the algorithm without human control. The article also tells that Unilever collaborates with the startup Holistic AI to benchmark and improve these processes over time, and is preparing for the requirements in the EU's upcoming AI legislation. The Unilever case illustrates how a global company proactively builds data ethics into its innovation model, rather than waiting for regulatory pressure.",

The authors highlight several key dimensions: Transparency – businesses must ensure that AI decisions are understandable and verifiable to build trust. Fairness and bias – the study points out the importance of diverse datasets and awareness of algorithmic bias to avoid discriminatory outcomes. It also addresses the broader socio-economic consequences: Business AI strategies should consider effects on employment, inequality, and accessibility. Furthermore, privacy and data security are emphasized as an ethical imperative – when companies collect enormous amounts of data, they must protect individuals' privacy to maintain trust. The recommendation is that responsible AI must be integrated into companies' CSR frameworks: Through openness, fairness, and good data practices, organizations can navigate the complex AI landscape in a way that benefits both the business and society.

    summary:
      "This article (from an industry perspective) highlights the risk of bias in AI-driven recruitment tools. It refers, among other things, to a well-known example at Amazon, where an experimental AI for CV screening turned out to favor male candidates for technical positions – an unintended effect of the algorithm learning from historical data characterized by gender biases. The result was that Amazon had to scrap the project to avoid discrimination. The Forbes article argues that such incidents illustrate the need to build in transparency and fairness controls in HR AI: algorithms must be explained and tested for bias before being put to use. Furthermore, a combined approach is encouraged where AI is used as support, but where humans still make final decisions in hiring processes to maintain ethical judgment. This case is a reminder that without conscious governance, AI can reinforce biases rather than eliminate them – which can harm both the company's reputation and diversity goals.",

    summary:
      "The EU's groundbreaking AI regulation is expected to be adopted in 2024 and will phase in comprehensive requirements affecting businesses globally. EY summarizes that the AI Act introduces a risk-based framework: 'High-risk' AI systems (e.g., in recruitment, credit scoring, health) must meet strict requirements for data management, documentation, transparency, and human oversight. For companies, this means new compliance costs and the need to adapt AI development processes. The law's effects span broadly – for example, prohibitions on certain practices (such as social scoring and manipulative AI) will take effect shortly after the law formally enters into force. Large multinational players like Unilever have already indicated that they will adopt the EU's requirements globally for their AI systems, just as GDPR became a global standard. This upcoming regulation anchors data ethics in law, and forces that responsible AI is no longer just 'best practice' but a legal requirement. Leaders must therefore understand the AI Act and begin preparing the organization (through mapping AI use, establishing governance routines, etc.) to avoid fines and reputational damage when the rules take effect in 2025-2026.",
