        Decide what you want your AI to do â€“ for example, a personal writing assistant, a customer 
        support chatbot, an idea generator, or a simple business automation. Keep the scope simple 
        (e.g. answering FAQs or scheduling help) to match a beginner's capability.

        Start with easy-to-access LLMs: for instance, use ChatGPT via OpenAI (through the web UI or 
        the OpenAI API) or Google's Gemini if available. These services let you leverage powerful 
        models without setup.

        ]}
      >
        In the chat interface, try asking the LLM to perform your task. Refine your prompts to get better 
        results (this is "prompt engineering"). For example, if creating a content assistant, prompt it 
        with "You are a helpful writing assistant. Help me draft an email about X."

        If you want a custom interface (like a simple web app or chatbot UI) without coding everything, 
        leverage AI app builders like Vercel's V0.dev, Lovable.dev, or other no-code platforms that can 
        help you build a functional application.
