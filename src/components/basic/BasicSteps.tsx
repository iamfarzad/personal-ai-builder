        Decide what you want your AI to do â€“ for example, a personal writing assistant, a customer 
        support chatbot, an idea generator, or a simple business automation. Keep the scope simple 
        (e.g. answering FAQs or scheduling help) to match a beginner's capability.

        Start with easy-to-access LLMs: for instance, use ChatGPT via OpenAI (through the web UI or 
        the OpenAI API) or Google's Gemini if available. These services let you leverage powerful 
        models without setup.

        In the chat interface, try asking the LLM to perform your task. Refine your prompts to get better 
        results (this is "prompt engineering"). For example, if creating a content assistant, prompt it 
        with "You are a helpful writing assistant. Help me draft an email about X."
