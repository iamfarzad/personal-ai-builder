              Decide what you want your AI to do â€“ for example, a personal writing assistant, a customer 
              support chatbot, an idea generator, or a simple business automation. Keep the scope simple 
              (e.g. answering FAQs or scheduling help) to match a beginner's capability.

              Start with easy-to-access LLMs: for instance, use ChatGPT via OpenAI (through the web UI or 
              the OpenAI API) or Google's Gemini if available. These services let you leverage powerful 
              models without setup.

              In the chat interface, try asking the LLM to perform your task. Refine your prompts to get better 
              results (this is "prompt engineering"). For example, if creating a content assistant, prompt it 
              with "You are a helpful writing assistant. Help me draft an email about X."
